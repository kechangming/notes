# 3-dimensional Volcano Plot
The conversion rates of methanol at 474 K under EEFs for different metallic alloys can be estimated with the python script 3d_data_generation_T473K.py, whose output is newn_T473K_interp.csv. We offer a python notebook 3D volcanoplot.nb to generate the 3D volcano plot from newn_T473K_interp.csv.
