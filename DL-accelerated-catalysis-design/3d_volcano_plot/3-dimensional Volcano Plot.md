# 3-dimensional Volcano Plot
The conversion of methanol at 474 K is obtained from the simplied kinetic model and generated by [3d_data_generation_T473K.py](./3d_data_generation_T473K.py). And [newn_T473K_interp.csv](./newn_T473K_interp.csv) is its output. [3D volcanoplot.nb](./3D volcanoplot.nb) is used to generate the 3D volcano plot.
