# How to construct a 3D volcano plot of EEF catalysis?
Here, we give a tutorial for constration of 3D volcano plot of steam reforming of methanol (SRM) under EEFs.

Include 4 parts:
[1](./1. Microkinetics_of_steam_reforming_of_methanol). Construct the microkinetics of steam reforming of methanol with EEF effect
[2](./2. Simplified_kinetics_with_scaling_relationship). Simplify the microkinetics and derive a simplified kinetics of SRM with scaling relationship.
[3](./3. Adsorption_energies_prediction_by_DL). Predict the O and C adsorption assisted by deep learning.
[4](./4. 3d_volcano_plot). Polt the 3D volcano plot.

more detail you can see the subfolder.

Construction of 3D volcano plot includes [the kinetics of steam reforming of methanol](./kinetics_of_steam_reforming_of_methanol/Establishment_of_microkinetics_of_methanol_steam_reforming.md) and [adsorption energies prediction by deep learning](./adsorption_energies_prediction_by_DL/Adsorption_Energies_Prediction_by_Deep_Learning.md).
